         <h2> Where to Eat</h2>

         <h3>This is not the aspirational fluff of Instagram wall neon; it's fact. Recent surveys have shown that a majority of
             travelers consider food first when planning a trip, even ahead of where they sleep. Add to this that people are also 
             traveling more than ever before 
             - earthlings logged a record-breaking 1.4 billion international 
            trips last year - and it's safe to say that the hunger for new culinary experiences is more ravenous than ever.</h3>
